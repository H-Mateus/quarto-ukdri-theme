## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

> This is part of the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/).

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

> This is part of the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/).

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

> This is part of the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/).

You can also add `text marked as code`!

## You can add R code

```{r}
#| echo = TRUE
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
g <- starwars |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  theme_light()
```

## And show the results aswell :)

```{r}
#| fig.align='center',
#| echo = TRUE
g 
```

## What about tables?

### `knitr::kable()`

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
tab <- starwars |>
  tidyr::drop_na(species) |> 
  group_by(species) |>
  summarise(n = n(),
            mean_heigth = round(mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)),
            mean_mass = round(mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE))
            ) |> 
  slice_max(order_by = n, n = 4) 

knitr::kable(tab)
```

## `DT::datatable()` {.smaller}

With the `smaller` class in the slide! Ex:  ` ## slide name {.smaller}`

```{r}
DT::datatable(tab)
```


---

## `gt::gt()` 

```{r}
gt::gt(tab)
```

---

## `reactable::reactable()` 

```{r}
reactable::reactable(tab)
```
